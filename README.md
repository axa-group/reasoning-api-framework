# Reasoning API Framework

A tool to rapidly model contract rules and expose them as APIs for integration with conversational agents.

![Editor](resources/editor.png?raw=true "Editor")

## Description

This code was developed by the [AXA REV research team](https://axa-rev-research.github.io/) to serve as prototype to rapidly model contract rules and expose them as APIs for integration with conversational agents.

Main features:

- Intuitive, [mxGraph](https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph) powered user interface to model contract rules (statements)
- Easy API url setup and instant data updates
- Built-in error prevention based on the quality engineering principle of [poka-yoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poka-yoke)
- Multi-tenancy: Operate APIs for multiple contracts within one framework
- User authentication using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and role-based user authorization using [cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)

## Setup
